## **Part 1: Understanding Prompt Engineering**


**Meet Alex - The Prompt Engineer Success Story**:
"Alex was a customer service representative making $35,000 per year. After learning prompt engineering, she now works as an AI consultant helping companies automate their customer service. She makes $85,000 per year and works from home. The difference? She learned how to ask AI the right questions to solve business problems."

**What You'll Learn Today**:
- What prompt engineering actually is (in simple terms)
- Why it's one of the most valuable skills today
- How to create prompts that get amazing results
- Real job opportunities and salary expectations

### **What is Prompt Engineering? - The Simple Explanation**

**Think of Prompt Engineering Like This**:
"Imagine you're giving directions to someone. If you say 'Go somewhere,' they won't know where to go. But if you say 'Go to the grocery store on Main Street, turn left at the traffic light, and it's the red building on the right,' they'll find it easily. Prompt engineering is like giving clear, detailed directions to AI."

**Simple Definition**:
- **Prompt**: The question or instruction you give to AI/The set of instructions and data you provide to an LLM.
- **Engineering**: The skill of designing prompts that get the best results/The systematic design, testing, and refinement of those instructions.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Learning how to ask AI questions in the most effective way/The art and science of communicating your intent to an AI to achieve desired outcomes reliably and efficiently.

**Real-World Examples**:

**Example 1 - Bad Prompt**:
❌ "Write something about marketing"

**Example 1 - Good Prompt**:
✅ "Write a 200-word blog post about social media marketing for small businesses. Include 3 practical tips and use a friendly, encouraging tone."

**Example 2 - Bad Prompt**:
❌ "Help me with my resume"

**Example 2 - Good Prompt**:
✅ "I'm applying for a marketing coordinator position at a tech startup. I have 2 years of experience in social media and a degree in communications. Help me write a professional resume that highlights my social media skills and shows I can work in a fast-paced environment."

**Why the Good Prompts Work**:
- **Specific**: Clear about what you want
- **Detailed**: Includes important background information
- **Actionable**: AI knows exactly what to do
- **Contextual**: AI understands the situation

## **Part 4: Advanced Prompt Techniques**

### **Technique 1: Chain of Thought Prompting**

**What It Is**: Asking AI to show its thinking process

**Why It Works**: AI gives better answers when it explains its reasoning

**Simple Example**:
❌ "What's the best way to save money?"

✅ "What's the best way to save money? Please think through this step by step, considering different income levels and situations, then give me your recommendation."

**Step-by-Step Instructions**:
1. Ask your question
2. Add: "Please think through this step by step"
3. Ask for the reasoning behind the answer
4. Request the final recommendation

### **Technique 2: Few-Shot Learning**

**What It Is**: Giving AI examples of what you want

**Why It Works**: AI learns from examples, just like humans

**Simple Example**:
```
Write a product description in this style:

Example 1: "Our organic coffee beans are hand-picked from the mountains of Colombia. Each cup delivers rich, smooth flavor that will energize your morning. Perfect for coffee lovers who care about quality and sustainability."

Example 2: "This wireless headphone set features crystal-clear sound and 20-hour battery life. Whether you're working out or commuting, you'll enjoy premium audio quality. Ideal for busy professionals who demand the best."

Now write a description for: [your product]
```

**Step-by-Step Instructions**:
1. Provide 2-3 examples of the style you want
2. Make sure examples are high quality
3. Ask AI to create something similar
4. Specify what the new content should be about

### **Technique 3: Iterative Refinement**

**What It Is**: Improving prompts through multiple attempts

**Why It Works**: Each version gets better as you learn what works

**Step-by-Step Process**:
1. **First attempt**: Try your initial prompt
2. **Evaluate**: What worked? What didn't?
3. **Refine**: Make specific improvements
4. **Test again**: Try the improved version
5. **Repeat**: Keep improving until you're satisfied

**Example of Iterative Improvement**:

**Attempt 1**: "Write a blog post about healthy eating"

**Attempt 2**: "Write a 500-word blog post about healthy eating for busy professionals"

**Attempt 3**: "Write a 500-word blog post about quick and healthy meal prep for busy professionals who work 50+ hours per week. Include 3 easy recipes and focus on time-saving tips."

**Attempt 4**: "Write a 500-word blog post about quick and healthy meal prep for busy professionals who work 50+ hours per week. Use a friendly, encouraging tone. Include 3 easy recipes that can be made in under 30 minutes, focus on time-saving tips, and end with motivation to start meal prepping. The target audience is working parents who want to eat better but struggle with time."

### **Lab Exercise 4: The Technique Drill**

**Task A (CoT)**: Take a prompt like "Should our company invest in renewable energy?" and add a Chain-of-Thought instruction. Compare the depth of the response to a simple yes/no query.

**Task B (Few-Shot)**: Ask the AI to write a product description for a coffee mug. Then, provide two examples of excellent product descriptions for other items and ask it to write one for the mug in the same style. Compare the results.

**Task C (Iteration)**: Start with a basic prompt: "Write a meeting agenda." Based on the output, give a follow-up command: "Now, make the agenda for a brainstorming meeting focused on launching a new product in Q4."

**Lab Exercise 4: Responsible Prompting & Identifying Limitations**

Task: Instruct students to ask an AI about a recent event that happened after its knowledge cutoff date (e.g., an event from last month). Goal: To demonstrate hallucinations—where the AI confidently generates incorrect or fabricated information.

Debrief: This is a critical lesson. Always fact-check critical information generated by AI. Teach students to use prompts like: "What is your knowledge cutoff date?" and "Based on your training data, what are the most likely facts about X?"
