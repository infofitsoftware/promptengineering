## **Part 2: Data Preparation for Fine-tuning (60 minutes)**

### **Understanding Data Requirements (30 minutes)**

**Think of Training Data Like Teaching Materials**:
"Training data is like the textbooks and examples you use to teach someone. The quality and quantity of your training data directly determines how well your fine-tuned model will perform. You need the right type, amount, and quality of data to succeed."

## **Part 3: LoRA and QLoRA Techniques (60 minutes)**

### **Understanding LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) (30 minutes)**

**Think of LoRA Like Adding Specialized Modules**:
"LoRA is like adding specialized modules to a general-purpose computer. Instead of changing the entire computer, you add small, specialized components that can be easily swapped in and out. This makes fine-tuning much more efficient and cost-effective."

**How LoRA Works**:

**1. Traditional Fine-tuning**
```
Original Model: 7B parameters
Fine-tuned Model: 7B parameters (all changed)
Training Cost: High (all parameters updated)
Storage: Large (full model saved)
```

**2. LoRA Fine-tuning**
```
Original Model: 7B parameters (frozen)
LoRA Adapters: 0.1B parameters (only these change)
Training Cost: Low (only adapters updated)
Storage: Small (only adapters saved)
```

**LoRA Benefits**:
- **Efficiency**: Train only 1-2% of model parameters
- **Cost**: 10-100x cheaper than full fine-tuning
- **Speed**: 5-10x faster training
- **Flexibility**: Easy to switch between different adapters
- **Storage**: Much smaller model files

**LoRA Implementation**:
```python
# LoRA configuration
lora_config = {
    "r": 16,  # Rank of adaptation
    "lora_alpha": 32,  # Scaling parameter
    "target_modules": ["q_proj", "v_proj"],  # Modules to adapt
    "lora_dropout": 0.1,  # Dropout rate
    "bias": "none",  # Bias adaptation
    "task_type": "CAUSAL_LM"  # Task type
}
```

### **Understanding QLoRA (Quantized LoRA) (30 minutes)**

**Think of QLoRA Like Compressing and Optimizing**:
"QLoRA is like compressing a large file and then making small, targeted changes to it. You get the benefits of LoRA (efficient fine-tuning) plus the benefits of quantization (reduced memory usage), making it possible to fine-tune large models on consumer hardware."

**How QLoRA Works**:

**1. Quantization**
```
Original Model: 16-bit precision (7B parameters)
Quantized Model: 4-bit precision (7B parameters)
Memory Usage: 75% reduction
Performance: Minimal impact on quality
```

**2. LoRA on Quantized Model**
```
Quantized Model: 4-bit precision (frozen)
LoRA Adapters: 16-bit precision (trainable)
Memory Usage: Very low
Training Speed: Very fast
```

**QLoRA Benefits**:
- **Memory Efficiency**: Can train on consumer GPUs
- **Cost Effective**: Very low training costs
- **Quality Preservation**: Maintains model performance
- **Accessibility**: Makes fine-tuning accessible to everyone
- **Scalability**: Can fine-tune very large models

**QLoRA Implementation**:
```python
# QLoRA configuration
qlora_config = {
    "load_in_4bit": True,  # Load model in 4-bit
    "bnb_4bit_use_double_quant": True,  # Double quantization
    "bnb_4bit_quant_type": "nf4",  # Quantization type
    "bnb_4bit_compute_dtype": torch.float16,  # Compute dtype
    "lora_config": lora_config  # LoRA configuration
}
```

## **Part 4: Model Evaluation and Testing (60 minutes)**

### **Understanding Model Evaluation (30 minutes)**

**Think of Model Evaluation Like Testing a Student**:
"Model evaluation is like testing a student to see how well they've learned. You need to test them on different types of questions, in different situations, and measure their performance objectively to ensure they're ready for real-world use."

**Evaluation Metrics**:

**1. Accuracy Metrics**
- **Exact Match**: Percentage of exactly correct answers
- **F1 Score**: Balance between precision and recall
- **BLEU Score**: Quality of generated text
- **ROUGE Score**: Quality of summaries

**2. Quality Metrics**
- **Coherence**: How well the response makes sense
- **Relevance**: How well the response answers the question
- **Completeness**: How complete the response is
- **Consistency**: How consistent the responses are

**3. Performance Metrics**
- **Latency**: How fast the model responds
- **Throughput**: How many requests per second
- **Memory Usage**: How much memory the model uses
- **Cost**: How much it costs to run the model

**4. Safety Metrics**
- **Bias Detection**: Check for biased responses
- **Toxicity**: Check for harmful content
- **Factual Accuracy**: Verify factual claims
- **Privacy**: Ensure no sensitive data leakage

### **Testing Strategies (30 minutes)**

**Strategy 1: Holdout Testing**
```
Training Data: 80% of available data
Validation Data: 10% of available data
Test Data: 10% of available data

Process:
1. Train model on training data
2. Validate on validation data
3. Test on test data (never seen before)
4. Report final performance on test data
```

**Strategy 2: Cross-Validation**
```
K-Fold Cross-Validation:
1. Split data into K folds
2. Train on K-1 folds, test on 1 fold
3. Repeat K times
4. Average results across all folds

Benefits:
- More robust evaluation
- Better use of limited data
- Reduced variance in results
```

**Strategy 3: A/B Testing**
```
Production A/B Test:
1. Deploy both models in production
2. Split traffic between models
3. Measure real-world performance
4. Choose better performing model

Benefits:
- Real-world evaluation
- User feedback integration
- Continuous improvement
```

**Strategy 4: Human Evaluation**
```
Human Evaluation Process:
1. Create evaluation rubric
2. Train human evaluators
3. Evaluate sample responses
4. Compare with automated metrics

Benefits:
- Subjective quality assessment

def evaluate_model(model, tokenizer, test_data):
    results = []
    
    for item in test_data:
        question = item["input"]
        expected_answer = item["output"]
        
        # Generate answer
        generated_answer = test_model(question)
        
        # Calculate metrics
        accuracy = calculate_accuracy(generated_answer, expected_answer)
        relevance = calculate_relevance(generated_answer, question)
        
        results.append({
            "question": question,

            "relevance": relevance
        })
    
    return results

def calculate_accuracy(generated, expected):
    # Simple word overlap accuracy
    generated_words = set(generated.lower().split())
    expected_words = set(expected.lower().split())
    
    if len(expected_words) == 0:
        return 0
    
    overlap = len(generated_words.intersection(expected_words))
    return overlap / len(expected_words)

def calculate_relevance(generated, question):
    # Simple relevance check
    question_words = set(question.lower().split())
    generated_words = set(generated.lower().split())
    
    if len(question_words) == 0:
        return 0
    
    overlap = len(question_words.intersection(generated_words))
    return overlap / len(question_words)
```

**Step 2**: Run evaluation

```python
# Evaluate the model
evaluation_results = evaluate_model(model, tokenizer, domain_data)

# Calculate overall metrics
overall_accuracy = sum([r["accuracy"] for r in evaluation_results]) / len(evaluation_results)
overall_relevance = sum([r["relevance"] for r in evaluation_results]) / len(evaluation_results)

print(f"Overall Accuracy: {overall_accuracy:.2f}")
print(f"Overall Relevance: {overall_relevance:.2f}")

# Print detailed results
for i, result in enumerate(evaluation_results):
    print(f"\nTest Case {i+1}:")
    print(f"Question: {result['question']}")
    print(f"Expected: {result['expected']}")
    print(f"Generated: {result['generated']}")
    print(f"Accuracy: {result['accuracy']:.2f}")
    print(f"Relevance: {result['relevance']:.2f}")
```

**Step 3**: Performance testing

```python
# Test inference speed
import time

def test_inference_speed(model, tokenizer, test_questions, num_runs=10):
    times = []
    
    for _ in range(num_runs):
        start_time = time.time()
        
        for question in test_questions:
            test_model(question)
        
        end_time = time.time()
        times.append(end_time - start_time)
    
    avg_time = sum(times) / len(times)
    print(f"Average inference time: {avg_time:.2f} seconds")
    print(f"Questions per second: {len(test_questions) / avg_time:.2f}")
    
    return avg_time

# Test inference speed

- **"I'm running out of memory"** → Use QLoRA, reduce batch size, use gradient checkpointing
- **"My model isn't improving"** → Check data quality, adjust learning rate, increase training data
- **"My model is overfitting"** → Add regularization, reduce model complexity, increase training data

### **Engagement Strategies**:
- **Use real examples**: Connect to their work or business interests
- **Encourage experimentation**: Let them try different approaches
- **Celebrate improvements**: When they build working models, acknowledge it
- **Connect to career goals**: Show how fine-tuning skills help their job prospects

### **Making It Accessible**:
- **Provide templates**: Give them starting points for different fine-tuning tasks
- **Use simple language**: Avoid jargon and complex technical concepts
- **Offer multiple examples**: Show different approaches to the same problem
- **Give practical frameworks**: Structures they can follow

### **What to Do If Students Struggle**:
1. **Start with simple examples**: Don't make them tackle complex fine-tuning immediately
2. **Provide step-by-step guidance**: Break down complex tasks into manageable steps
3. **Encourage practice**: The more they fine-tune models, the better they get
4. **Focus on understanding**: Help them understand the concepts, not just the code
