## **Instructor Notes**

### **Common Student Questions**:
- **"When should I use advanced techniques vs. basic ones?"** → Advanced for complex problems, basic for simple tasks
- **"How do I know which advanced technique to use?"** → Match technique to problem type and requirements
- **"Can I use multiple techniques together?"** → Yes, combining techniques often works better
- **"How do I implement Constitutional AI principles?"** → Start with safety, then add other principles

### **Troubleshooting for Beginners**:
- **"Advanced techniques seem too complex"** → Start with one technique, practice until comfortable
- **"I don't understand the difference between techniques"** → Use the analogies and examples provided
- **"My results aren't better with advanced techniques"** → Make sure you're using them for appropriate problems
- **"Constitutional AI seems restrictive"** → Explain that it's about responsible, professional AI use

### **Engagement Strategies**:
- **Use real examples**: Connect to their work or daily life
- **Encourage experimentation**: Let them try different approaches
- **Celebrate breakthroughs**: When they master a technique, acknowledge it
- **Connect to career goals**: Show how these skills command premium rates

### **Making It Accessible**:
- **Provide clear analogies**: Use simple comparisons to explain complex concepts
- **Use step-by-step examples**: Show exactly how to implement each technique
- **Offer templates**: Give them frameworks to follow
- **Give practical frameworks**: Decision trees and checklists they can use

### **What to Do If Students Struggle**:
1. **Start with one technique**: Don't overwhelm them with all four
2. **Use simple examples**: Begin with basic applications
3. **Provide templates**: Give them structures to follow
4. **Encourage questions**: Create a safe space for learning
