**Template Inheritance**:
```
Base Template: [Common structure]
Specialized Templates: [Domain-specific variations]
Custom Templates: [User-specific modifications]
```

### **Template Testing Framework**:

**Test Scenarios**:
1. **Basic functionality**: Does it work as expected?
2. **Edge cases**: How does it handle unusual inputs?
3. **Quality consistency**: Are results consistently good?
4. **Performance**: How fast does it produce results?
5. **User experience**: Is it easy to use?

**Testing Process**:
1. **Define test cases**: Create specific scenarios to test
2. **Run tests**: Execute template with test cases
3. **Evaluate results**: Rate quality, consistency, completeness
4. **Document findings**: Record what works and what doesn't
5. **Iterate**: Improve template based on results

**Success Metrics**:
- **Quality Score**: 1-10 rating of output quality
- **Consistency Score**: How similar results are across tests
- **Completeness Score**: How well it addresses requirements
- **Usability Score**: How easy it is to use
- **Time Savings**: How much time it saves vs. manual prompting
