```
"Think of this like organizing a library. You take books (documents), break them into chapters (chunks), create index cards (embeddings), and store them in organized shelves (vector database)."

**Step 2: Query Processing**
```
User Question → Embedding → Vector Search → Retrieved Documents
```
"When someone asks a question, you create an index card for their question, find the most similar index cards in your library, and retrieve those chapters."

**Step 3: Answer Generation**
```
Retrieved Documents + User Question → AI Model → Final Answer
```
"You give the AI both the user's question and the relevant documents, and it creates a comprehensive, accurate answer."

**Latest 2024 RAG Trends**:

## **Part 6: Hybrid Search Techniques**

### **Understanding Hybrid Search**

**Think of Hybrid Search Like Having Both a Librarian and a Search Engine**:
"Hybrid search is like having both a librarian who understands the meaning of your question (vector search) and a search engine that finds exact matches (keyword search). By combining both approaches, you get the best of both worlds - semantic understanding and precise matching."

**Hybrid Search Components**:

**1. Vector Search (Semantic)**
- **Purpose**: Find documents based on meaning and context
- **Example**: Query "car problems" finds documents about "automotive issues"
- **Pros**: Understands synonyms, context, meaning
- **Cons**: May miss exact matches, can be slow

**2. Keyword Search (Lexical)**
- **Purpose**: Find documents based on exact word matches
- **Example**: Query "car problems" finds documents containing "car" and "problems"
- **Pros**: Fast, precise, handles exact matches
- **Cons**: Misses synonyms, context, meaning

**3. Hybrid Combination**
- **Purpose**: Combine both approaches for better results
- **Methods**: Weighted combination, reciprocal rank fusion, learned combination
- **Example**: 70% vector search + 30% keyword search
- **Pros**: Best of both worlds, higher accuracy
- **Cons**: More complex, requires tuning

### **Hybrid Search Implementation**

**Method 1: Weighted Combination**
```
Vector Score: 0.8 (semantic similarity)
Keyword Score: 0.6 (exact match)
Final Score: (0.8 × 0.7) + (0.6 × 0.3) = 0.74
```
**Implementation**: Combine scores with predefined weights
**Tuning**: Adjust weights based on query type and domain
**Use Case**: General-purpose search systems

**Method 2: Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**
```
Document A: Rank 1 in vector search, Rank 3 in keyword search
RRF Score: 1/(1+1) + 1/(1+3) = 0.5 + 0.25 = 0.75
```
**Implementation**: Combine rankings using RRF formula
**Advantage**: Handles different score scales automatically
**Use Case**: Systems with different search engines

**Method 3: Learned Combination**
```
Features: Vector score, keyword score, query length, document type
Model: Machine learning model to predict relevance
Output: Combined relevance score
```
**Implementation**: Train ML model to combine search results
**Advantage**: Learns optimal combination from data
**Use Case**: Large-scale systems with training data

**Method 4: Query-Aware Combination**
```
Technical Query: 80% vector + 20% keyword
Factual Query: 20% vector + 80% keyword
Creative Query: 90% vector + 10% keyword
```
**Implementation**: Adjust weights based on query type
**Advantage**: Optimizes for different query types
**Use Case**: Multi-domain search systems

## **Resources for Students**

### **RAG Implementation Templates**:

**Basic RAG Template**:
```python
# Basic RAG implementation
def basic_rag_system(documents, query):
    # 1. Process documents
    chunks = chunk_documents(documents)
    
    # 2. Create embeddings
    embeddings = create_embeddings(chunks)
    
    # 3. Store in vector database
    vectorstore = store_embeddings(embeddings)
    
    # 4. Retrieve relevant chunks
    relevant_chunks = vectorstore.similarity_search(query, k=5)
    
    # 5. Generate answer
    answer = generate_answer(query, relevant_chunks)
    
    return answer
```

**Advanced RAG with Reranking**:
```python
# Advanced RAG with reranking
def advanced_rag_system(documents, query):
    # 1-4. Same as basic RAG
    
    # 5. Rerank results
    reranked_chunks = rerank_documents(query, relevant_chunks)
    
    # 6. Generate answer
    answer = generate_answer(query, reranked_chunks)
    
    return answer
```

**Hybrid Search Template**:
```python
# Hybrid search implementation
def hybrid_search(query, vector_weight=0.7):
    # Vector search
    vector_results = vector_search(query)
    
    # Keyword search
    keyword_results = keyword_search(query)
    
    # Combine results
    combined_results = combine_results(
        vector_results, 
        keyword_results, 
        vector_weight
    )
    
    return combined_results
```
